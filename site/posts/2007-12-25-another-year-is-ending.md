Wow, this was heavy, wasn't it? I'm absolutely sure that you don't know, what I'm talking about. Well, the past month was quite stressful for me, as I had to finish a huge project in my old job. But that is done, and I can finally enjoy my deserved holidays. So, let's have a short flashback at this year (don't care about the order):

- I found a new favorite pub
- I joined a band as guitarist
- I finished Ancient Remains for Tremulous
- I published my new website with my new logo
- I passed my apprenticeship to a media designer
- I found a new flat for a good price in the center of my city
- I started playing Texas hold'em Poker
- You donated over 150 Euro via PayPal to me
- I found a teleworking job in a friend's company
- I just got a new PC (oh man, this was needed)
- After a long time I bought a game again (ETQW)

All in all, this was a good year. If the next year only holds half that much good things, I would be very happy. So, what are the things which I planned for 2008? Well, there are some, if not a lot. I'm yet actively contributing to the Zend Framework with lot's of proposals like Zend_Whois, Zend_Ical, Zend_Ascii and Zend_Mpc. I will surely continue with that by always contributing more proposals, but what else will I do?

As I'm not really playing Tremulous anymore, my map Aurora is slowly progressing, but hopefuly I will find some time to finish it some day before Tremulous 1.2 is out. But as I'm sick of creating maps for old engines, I will soon switch to a more modern (still Linux friendly) game engine, maybe Quake Wars itself.

And what about Tremradio, you may ask yourself? Well, I decided to give this job over to Ingar, after he has bought new equipment to make the show. Until then, the shows will still be frozen.

In the summary, I've loaded too many projects on my back this year. Because of this, I had always problems to finish the one or the other project, or even to have some time for myself. I planned to change this in the future and to use my spare time to enjoy life a bit more.

Well, what else could I say? There's nothing left at the moment. I wish you all merry chrismas and a good start in the next year.
