Today I've got something new for you. Within the last seven days (pretty good tv-series by the way), I created a JavaScript clone of the famous game Gnome Klotski.

It took me about three days to create Drawing-API, which worked interestingly directly in all browsers without any tweeks or hacks. Two other days I worked on the movement API, one day for the highscore system (which is pretty cheat-safe) and the last day for the general GUI and creation of the different puzzles.

The game needs absolutely no graphics, except the loading-animation. You can play it online and get into the highscores at [klotski.de](http://www.klotski.de). Take a break and have fun.
