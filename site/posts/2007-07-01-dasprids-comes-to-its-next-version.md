After another year, I decided to create the next version of my website. I hired different web designers to create a design for me, because I wanted a really great design this time. But after over 5 months, as no designer did anything good or in time, I decided to make it on my own again. Now it does not have any eye candy, but it has a simple look, just like the old development section, and an easy structure.

However, here it is, and I'm proud to present it to you. I have now combined my two sub sites, the private and the development part, into one single website. Now you can find all information you are seeking behind the single menu entries. As a prove to myself, I have written the website system entirely in [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/). This is a kinda really cool framework and has a high quallity standard.

By the way, I integrated a [forum](http://forum) for the development and server purposes. So If you want to tell me some common things, suggest maps or settings for my game server, or you just want to do some public discussions, this is the right place for you.

Then I have extended the section [about myself](/about/), and added a photo to it. I have also added things to the other sections, just have a look around.

The most important change is, that the site contents are complety written in english now. So I hope to reach a bigger audience than before. Maybe my german friends will beat me in the ass for this, but they are no more that important.

All in all, I hope that this new site will hand you all information you are seeking for. And if you have any suggestions to improve it, just [tell me](/contact/).
