After some waiting, Zend_Text_Figlet and Zend_Text_Ascii got approved and were moved to the incubator. I will now try to finish Zend_Text_Figlet's unit tests and documentation within the next week, so that it can maybe move to the standard core with Zend Framework 1.6. Zend_Text_Ascii will then follow within the next month.

So all in all I guess that I can call myself the father of the Zend_Text category ;)
