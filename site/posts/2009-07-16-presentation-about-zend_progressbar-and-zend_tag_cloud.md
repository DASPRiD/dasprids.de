At the beginning of July, I made a presentation about Zend_ProgressBar and Zend_Tag_Cloud in our local usergroup. As it was filmed, I'm now going to publish it online. Surely, this is all in german, so sorry for all my visitors who can't understand it. You will (hopefully) get an (extended) english version on IPC or PHPNW.

To everyone else who understands german, enjoy the presentation. I have uploaded the slides as well, as the code examples are not very readable on the video.
