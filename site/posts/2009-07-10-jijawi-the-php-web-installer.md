A few days ago, I started a small open source project, which came out of my mind a long time ago; Jijawi. Quote from the proiject page:

> Jijawi (Jijawi Is Just Another Web Installer) is an easy way to distribute your PHP web application to your users. It comes with a complete modular structure, which allows you to modify the installer as much as you want with the least possible effort. Jijawi supplies you with a System-Check and a MySQL module by default, so you can get the most common installer running in a few minutes.

There is no release available at this time, but will follow pretty soon. You can find out more on the project website: http://jijawi.org.
