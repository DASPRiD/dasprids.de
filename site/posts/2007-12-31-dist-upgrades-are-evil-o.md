That was a hard job. I have finally managed it to upgrade my old Debian Sarge to a half Edge. But there were thousands of problems, mainly with Courier and Python2.4 and Trac. Today somebody told me, that ProFTPd didn't worked. It took me about two hours now to fix the problem, but it finally works. The anonymous login for my download section is still missing, but will be fixed tomorrow.

I wish you all a good start in the year 2008 and don't drink too much ;)
