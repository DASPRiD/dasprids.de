Alright, seems that my brother is less lazy than I'm at the moment. He has created a promo video for the (in the meantime) standalone game UrbanTerror. Friendly, as I've always been, I allowed him to upload his video to my FTP server. 

If you don't know this game yet, you should really take a look at the video, but if you still know UrbanTerror, you should take a look at it under any circumstances. It's a masterpeace compared to the videos I've seen in the long past.

And because my visitors (including you) are always as lazy like me, I offer you the download link right here, instead of letting you search it:
