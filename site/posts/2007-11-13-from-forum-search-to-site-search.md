I finally made it. Since I switched my old server from PHP 4 to PHP 5, I was no longer able to use [mnogosearch](http://www.mnogosearch.org/), the best (and free) search engine on the web. Now I managed it to compile it for my PHP 5.2 version. From now on, the search form at the upper right can be used to search the entire site, not only the forums anymore.
