The long wait is finally over. Some hours ago, Firefox 3 was finally released, and it took only some hours until it was available in the Ubuntu repositories. Thus It was quickly on my hard drive. There wasn't that many changes to the RC 1 release, but some new bugfixed made their way into the final release. Now go, get your peace of the new web and download Firefox 3!
