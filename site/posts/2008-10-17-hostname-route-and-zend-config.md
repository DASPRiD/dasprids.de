Long time ago, I wrote the hostname routing for ZF 1.6. At that point there was no possibility to use them via Zend_Config. With my newest commit that has changed now, and you'll get it with the RC1 release of ZF 1.7. In the meantime, you can surely take a look at the trunk of how it works. An example for an XML config is added to the documentation of the hostname route.
