Finally the ZF guys managed to enable my SVN access to the ZF repository. Ralph is cleaning up some stuff which is lying around in the Incubator, then I can commit the attribute support for Zend_Config_Xml there. Since it is complete and the unit tests for it exist it won't take long to move from the incubator to the core. So, I guess it will be available in the next major release (1.6), or maybe even in the next mini release. I don't know about the manual yet but I will ask Ralph about that later.

And well, which proposal is next? Good question, currently Zend_Ical is pending for recommendation but has been for a long time. My liaison of that proposal has not contacted me yet. So I bet one of the other proposals will make it first.  Maybe Zend_Config_Db or Zend_Whois.

**Update:** Zend_Config_Xml Attribute support is now in the incubator.
