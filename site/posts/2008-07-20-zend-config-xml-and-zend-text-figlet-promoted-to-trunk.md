Before I forget it, some days ago, Zend_Text_Figlet and Zend_Config_Xml attribute support were promoted to trunk. So they both will be available in 1.6. As for Zend_Text_Figlet, there will follow a Zend_Form_Element_Captcha adapter, which will utilize it. Don't know, if it will make it into 1.6 or 1.7 later.
