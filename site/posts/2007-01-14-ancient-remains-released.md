Alright guys. I'm happy to tell you that I've released Ancient Remains today. I worked over 16 weeks on this now, so nearly 4 months, but now I'm done. You can download it from the download section of Ancient Remains in the map section.

Remember, this is the final version, so I won't do any changes anymore. Only if many guys find new bugs or want greater changes, I will do them until the Tremulous 1.2 release. Also remember, if the performance is very bad for you outside, you will be able to switch the grass off in the options.

Happy Fragging,
