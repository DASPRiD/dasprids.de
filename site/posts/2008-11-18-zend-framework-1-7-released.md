I'm probably some hours too late, but hey, who cares. Today the 1.7 version of the Zend Framework was released, including many new components, features and bugfixes, the most important ones mentioned in the previous article. Sadly I was not able to get the partial path based chain routing done, but I will try to bring it to a good end with Martel for 1.8.

So the question now is, what do I have left for 1.8? Beside a silly component called Zend_Mpc, there is ZendX_Whois, on which I'm working with Dolf Schimmel, Zend_Ical, which is currently in a very early state, and Zend_Application, a new core component for the Zend Framework. As I will have about three months for the next release, this will be a good timeframe to complete those components.

And now, enjoy the [new Zend Framework version](http://framework.zend.com/download/latest)!
