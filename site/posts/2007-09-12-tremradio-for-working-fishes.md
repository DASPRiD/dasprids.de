I always sit at work, and I don't have my music there. So what's the easiest solution? Right, creating a playlist in [ncmpc](http://hem.bredband.net/kaw/ncmpc/), and let [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) stream everything to my [Icecast](http://www.icecast.org/) server. Now you can listen to Tremradio whenever you want, the playlist will always run with kickass music as you are used to it.

The stream works with title streaming, so if you like a song, you will now be able to see the title in your player. The problem with disconnects or reconnects after a title change is not related to the server, but to a buggy implementation in some libraries. So if you have problems with this, just change the player. You can connect to the stream like always, described on the [Tremradio](http://tremradio) subpage.
