Despite the fact that we wanted to wait for PHP 5.3 to be spreaded along all major Linux distributions, we decided to publish Zend Framework 2.0 in a shorter timeframe. This decision is supported by a clear demand by the users, who don't want to wait for PHP 5.3 support anymore. Since we won't be able to refactor all components we wanted, we are going to just convert everything to namespaces in ZF 2.0, and make the major refactoring in ZF 2.1. By this, you will get Zend Framework 2.0 in about two to three weeks.

By that time, we will also have moved to a new versioning system. As you know, we were valuating other versioning systems against the current SVN installation. Our first decision was, to move to GIT, but now we decided to go with [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), which offers a much better infrastructure than GIT or SVN could do. We will surely keep a read-only SVN repository, so those of you who are still using svn:externals are not left behind.

**Update**: This story was surely just an april fool ;)
