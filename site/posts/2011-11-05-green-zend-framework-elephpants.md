Since I was asked a few times about the green ZF elephpants, I'm clarifying this now. I'm in the process of creating ZF branded elephpants and everything is ready for now. The only thing missing is a total purchase quantity of at least 1000 small ones. The large elephpants have no minimum quantity after that. With a quantity of 1000 small elephpants, their price will be 7â‚¬.

I'm now taking pre-orders, **which have to contain at least 50 small elephpants**, and optional any amount of large ones. As soon as I have the total purchase quantity, production will begin and take between 3 to 6 months. If you want to make a pre-order, send an e-mail to mail@dasprids.de, telling me your shipping address and the quantities you want. Elephpants will be send from France, so there will be additional shipping costs. You will surely receive an invoice together with the shipping.

For those who like to order, here is a mockup of the green elephpant:

Also, I was just asked about the size of the small and large elephpants. Just take a look at this picture:

**Update**: You can now pre-order ZF elephpants in any amount on this page:
