Alright, no I finally made it into the US. My flight started 15:00 CEST in Germany, and 12 hours later, I reached Los Angeles (18:00 PDT). There I had to wait 4 hours for my next flight, but like on every good flight, I came to know some nice girl, which was travelling with me till Santa Barbara. So after the next flight there in a tiny 50-passenger machine, I was alone again, and it was like 0:00 PDT.

As my next flight was just going to leave in 6 hours and as nobody else was on the really tiny airport yet, I tried to sleep a bit, which was sadly impossible due to the loud announces every 10 minutes.  At 3 o'clock some other traveller arrived via bus (who was some metal-head as well ;)) and so I had some with who I could spend some hours of talking.

Then when my next flight was leaving, and I came through the security check, I was informed that I would be the only passenger on the flight. So I walked to the airplane and were welcomed by a nice stewardess to my "private jet":

Well, after another hour, I reached my final target, San Jose, where I took a taxi to my hotel. When I arrived there (8 o'clock), I had some problem with the check-in, as I had to credit card. So I contacted my boss via ICQ (they had open wlan in the lobby), and resolved the issue quickly. 3 hours later I could finally go to sleep (I was awake for 33 hour then). When I woke up, it was 5 o'clock in the morning, so it was kinda a perfect timing.
