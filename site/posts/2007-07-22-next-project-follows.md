After handling around with more and more batch files to compile my maps, I have now invented a nice GUI for Q3map2, called [Q3map2 Kit](/programing/q3map2kit), which is not only runable on Linux, but on Windows and Mac. It will only handle the compiling itself at the beginning, but offer more features in a later state.
