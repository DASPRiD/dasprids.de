After a long amount of time, I have decided to publish the development files of Ancient Remains and Hamunaptra. By this step I hope, that some people may learn to produce better maps than before, and maybe some guys do want to polish them a bit.

I have included the map files, the ase file and some textures, which are missed in the official release. Anyway, to use the devel-package, you have also to download the map-package.

Have fun and good luck with this.
