So the ZendCon is finally over. I was a lot of fun and very nice to meet all those people. Also the session were very interesting and I've learned a lot about stuff which I didn't knew before. I'm know staying here in Santa Clara until Saturday, and then will fligh back to Germany (arriving around 14:00 at Sunday). After all I would really like to stay here even longer, but work is calling again.

And well, I didn't take many photos by myself, as I were too busy with all the stuff, but gladly many other guys took photos and published them on flickr. You can find them all under the tag "zendcon08" [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/zendcon08/).

A very interesting part yesterday was the after-zendcon-party in a steakhous in San Jose. It was a really good entertained dinner, just the price was a bit hard: $2700.

By the way, I had some talks with the ZF team about future ideas of the Zend Framework, and most certainly my next proposal will be Zend_Bootstrap (or Zend_Application, the naming of the component isn't decided yet).

So, I'm looking forward to ZendCon09 and I hope that all of the guys this year will return as well.
