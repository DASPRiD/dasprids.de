Alright guys. After quite more searching, I finally found a good software for Linux to access my webcam via V4L2, it's called [fswebcam](http://www.firestorm.cx/fswebcam/).

The program takes some parameters to add text to the screenshot and let you adjust the output settings. With this little program, a quite smaller bash script and crontab I could realize a very neat webcam stream to the server, which occurs every five minutes.
