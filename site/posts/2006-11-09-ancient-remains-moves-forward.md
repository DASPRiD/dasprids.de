The last beta test found some last nasty bugs, and the  dungeons are also getting to an end. They still miss some more details, but they will follow in the next days. If everything works fine, the next test will be the last beta test. If there won't be any more great changes, a final test with a release candidate will follow soon after. If this one is ok, so if everything goes like I want, you can expect the final release of Ancient Remains in the next 2 weeks.

To the guys complaining about the grass/performance issue: WolfWings and myself did optimize the grass a lot. We turned it from a 4-segment patch to a single triangle. The grass was also reduced and extended with a fade-effect, so dretch navigation isn't that hard anymore as in the beginning.
