Hey folks,

I know that I didn't give any sign of live in the last two months, so now I want to give you an update on what's going on.

As I was very busy with my new job and small stuff here and there (and also needed a time-out from all the coding), I didn't move on with any of my projects. As I'm going for two conferences in October (which will be [PHPNW](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw09/) and [ZendCon](http://zendcon.com/)), where I'm speaking at atleast one of them, I'm currently in hurry with preparing the talk.

Either after the conferences are over, or if I find some time in between, I'm going to finish some stuff for ZendX_Whois, so that Dolf Schimmel can finish that component. My next two tasks then will be to work on Zend_Ical as well as Zend_Debug_Toolbar, tho I didn't decide yet, which one of them is my primary target. What's also left is Jijawi and the rewrite of my website's code, which both have a lower priority for now.

Beside all those coding stuff, I'm also going to review a book about PHP Team Development written by Samisa Abeysinghe. This book will help readers explore the process of breaking up complex PHP projects into simple sub-parts. It also introduces them to effective team work using MVC, agile development, source control, testing, bug tracking. If you don't want to wait for the review, you can buy it right here:

There also another interesting book on that site about Zend Framework 1.8 web application development, which you might want to have a look at:

For all of you comming to one of the conferences (or IPC in November), looking forward to meet you. To everyone else, keep watching my blog, there might be some more updates in the near future!
