Today I've created another proposal for Zend Framework, called Zend_Config_Db. It is intended to help out for saving runtime variables, which can be set in admin interfaces for instance. Those may be email addresses for contact forms, settings for how many items per page should be viewed somewhere and such things. Before continue working on the prototype I'd like to see your thoughts and ideas about it in the proposal comments.
