Finally we've got location and dates for this year's ZendCon! It will be held October 19th â€“ 22nd at the San Jose Convention Center. Until May 31st the [Call for Papers](http://zendcon.com/) will be open. As I'm most certainly going to attend this year again, I will try to get one or two sessions filled myself as speaker.

Two of my possible topics can be [Zend_ProgressBar](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.progressbar.html) and [Zend_Tag](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.tag.html). If applicable, I will also do a session about Zend_Application, maybe together with [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](http://weierophinney.net).

If you would like me to talk about any other topics as well, just leave a comment. But keep in mind to do it quickly, the call for papers won't be open forever.

Anyway, looking forward to meet as many of you guys as possible this year (again)!
