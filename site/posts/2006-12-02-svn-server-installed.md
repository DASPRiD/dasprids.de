After I had really much trouble with this, I managed to install a SVN server. Now you are always able to get the lastest version of Tremstats by checking it out from SVN. Simply type the following command to get the latest features and bugfixes:

svn checkout http://svn.dasprids.de/repos/tremstats/trunk
