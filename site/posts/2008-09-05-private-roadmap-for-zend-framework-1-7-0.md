Currently I have no ideas for new proposals, so I currently have a fixed plan of components I want to finish for Zend Framework 1.7.0. Those include the following:

- ZendX_Whois
- Zend_Console_ProgressBar
- Finishing Zend_Controller_Router chaining support together with Martel.

Zend_Text_Table is finished yet with unit tests and docmentation, and thus will surely be shipped with 1.7.0, but with some luck maybe earlier. As Zend_Ical is a quite huge component, it will be delayed for 1.8.0.
