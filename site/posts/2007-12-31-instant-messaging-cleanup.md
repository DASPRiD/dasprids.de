This was really needed. It took me more than 5 hours now, but I'm finally done. I have reduced the size of my instant messaging contacts from about 800 down to 100. Sorry to all guys, who maybe wished to stay in my contact list, but you can always contact me, then I will add you again.

By the way, I have also created a new MSN account:
