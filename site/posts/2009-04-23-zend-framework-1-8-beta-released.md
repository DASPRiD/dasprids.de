Finally you can test out all 1.8 components. Yesterday the beta release came out, together with an API code freeze. This means, that no further API changes or new components may be merged into the 1.8 branch. Gladly I could finish the documentation last weekend and thus it made it into the release. I already received feedback about lacking examples in the documentation, and so I will add some more. Beside that, I'm going to create a screencast for the GA release.
