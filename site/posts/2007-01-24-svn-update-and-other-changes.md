Because I wanted to split the single projects to several repositories each, I've moved Tremstats svn repository to http://tremstats.svn.dasprids.de/. I've also changed the naming of the nightly builds. Now there won't be the creation date anymore, but the revision number of the build. I hop that this will solve some confusions.
