While waiting for Zend_Whois to be review, so I can add support for more Top-Level-Domains, I have inserted a new proposal to the Zend Framework, called [Zend_Ical](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/x5I).

With this component you can access [ICS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icalendar) files via the local filesystem, FTP and webDAV. You will be able to fetch specific data from the files, using special criteria. You will also be able to write data back to the file, so you could create an entire calendar application with [Zend_Ical](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/x5I).

At the moment, I'm creating the class structure, and I will create a working prototype in the near future. This you then checkout from my private [SVN repository](http://zend_ical.svn.dasprids.de/), until the proposal gets accepted. Then it will be available through the Incubator, and maybe find it's way to Zend core.
