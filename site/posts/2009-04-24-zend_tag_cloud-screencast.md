Hey folks, I just managed it to get the screencast about Zend_Tag_Cloud done. There's a bit noise left in the audio which I could not remove because the sound was getting too low, but it is still fine and watchable. The entire file is about 100MB in size and encoded as DivX/MP3. I also uploaded it to blip.tv for those who prefer to watch screencasts in their browser. Have fun watching and I appreciate any feedback for further screencasts.
