As you may have seen (or not), the year of the last two postings is from December 2008. It seems, that this is a problem with the Zend Framework, but I have to check this later again.

-Update-
It wasn't a problem with the Zend Framework, but a missunderstanding with the documentation. I've used a format string, which gaves me the ISO year but not the real year.
