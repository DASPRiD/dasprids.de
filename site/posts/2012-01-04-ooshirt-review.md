A few weeks ago, I received an offer for a sponsorship by [Ooshirt](http://www.ooshirts.com) for two custom t-shirts. Funnily, their e-mail looked liked spam for me in the first moment, but I contacted them and it showed up as not being spam but a real offer.

So I took their offer and quickly created a t-shirt design with my logo on the front and the ZCE logos on the back. I couldn't align them perfectly myself in their online editor, so I marked it for review and one of their designers did that task for me. After receiving a sample image of how the shirts would look like, I confirmed the order.

As they are based in the USA and I'm in Germany, the shipping took a while to arrive here, but that is kinda normal. Eventually the t-shirts arrived today and the quality of both the shirts and the print look very well:

Thanks again to Ooshirt for their sponsorship and I can highly recommend them to anyone who wants to print their own clothes.
