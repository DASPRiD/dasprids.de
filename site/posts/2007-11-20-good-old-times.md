After I saw the video of my brother, I remembered the old video I made in the long long past, called Versus the World. It was intended to be a story movie built upon the story of UrbanTerror and it's past. Well, I did never really finished this movie, because I stopped playing UrbanTerror when I moved to Tremulous (and gave Windows a shot).

Anyway, after some searching I found this two old snippets of the video again. The first one contains the Intro and some trickjump scenes, the second is a short dubbed scence from Starship Troopers, which was a part of the entire movie. Enjoy it.
